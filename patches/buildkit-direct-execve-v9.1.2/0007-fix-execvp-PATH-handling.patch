Subject: [PATCH 7/7] fix execvp PATH handling

When the execvp syscall is invoked, the system PATH should be searched
for the executable to invoke, with the first match in the PATH being
invoked. However, the call being modified to inject qemu breaks this
behaviour, as it's not till _after_ qemu is invoked that the presence or
executability is checked, which is too late. ENOENT and EACCESS aren't
returned from the execve call, which stops execvp looping over the PATH
and aborts the entire process.

This is resolved by testing the target command prior to executing it via
qemu, returning the appropriate error codes.
