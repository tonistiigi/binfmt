This chart should be uninstalled as soon as successful deployment has been confirmed.

The following commands do just that in `bash` (adapt as needed):

until [[ "$(helm list --deployed -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} -qf {{ .Release.Name }})" = {{ .Release.Name }} ]]
do sleep .5
done
helm uninstall --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Release.Name }}
